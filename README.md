# US Medical Insurance Cost Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing a dataset of medical insurance charges in the United States. The goal is to explore the relationships between various demographic factors (age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region) and the insurance costs. The analysis aims to uncover trends and correlations that can help understand the factors influencing medical insurance charges.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains information on 1,338 individuals, with the following columns:

Age: Age of the policyholder.
Sex: Gender of the policyholder (male/female).
BMI: Body Mass Index (BMI) of the policyholder.
Children: Number of children or dependents covered by the insurance plan.
Smoker: Smoking status of the policyholder.
Region: The region where the policyholder resides (northwest, northeast, southwest, southeast).
Charges: Annual medical insurance charges billed to the policyholder.

### Analysis Goals

The analysis focuses on answering the following questions:

How do age and BMI affect insurance charges?
What is the impact of smoking on insurance costs?
Are there regional differences in insurance charges?
How does the number of children affect the cost of insurance?

### Tools & Libraries

Python: Data analysis and visualization.
Pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: Data visualization.

### Key Insights

Age and Charges: Analyzed the correlation between age and insurance charges to understand how costs change as policyholders age.
Smoking Status Impact: Examined how smoking status influences charges, highlighting the cost difference between smokers and non-smokers.
BMI and Charges: Investigated the relationship between BMI and insurance charges, identifying trends related to higher BMI values.
Regional Analysis: Compared average charges across different regions to find out if living in certain areas influences insurance costs.

### Next Steps

Perform regression analysis to predict insurance charges based on these features.
Explore potential interactions between variables (e.g., age and smoking status).
Use the findings to offer insights on how lifestyle changes could potentially impact insurance costs.
